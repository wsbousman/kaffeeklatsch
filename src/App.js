            Today, I got coffee with my friend Jake. He mentioned a friend who was working in UI/UX design, and that this friend had spent the last week writing a total of three lines of CSS. I didnt intend to come off as overconfident or entitled- but I may have said something to the effect of being able to manage that myself. Perhaps even four lines a week. Following coffee, I built and deployed this portfolio of mockups to showcase my frontend design abilities. Feel free to peruse them and, if you're interested, contact me. Thanks for looking.
